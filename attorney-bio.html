          <p>
            Steven Brown is a fourth generation Lake County native who graduated from Kelseyville High School in 2002.
            He attended William Penn University on a wrestling scholarship, where he completed his undergraduate degree.
          </p>
          <p>
            After graduating from William Penn in 2006, Steven returned to Lake County and attended Empire Law School at
            Empire College School of Law in Santa Rosa. He graduated cum laude in 2009 and was admitted to the State Bar
            of California in 2010. That same year he also became a certified mediator.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since opening his practice, Steven has focused his work on family law and criminal defense. He has handled
            a wide range of matters including divorce, parentage, child custody and visitation, support, guardianship,
            restraining orders, and civil harassment restraining orders, as well as misdemeanor and felony criminal
            cases and DUI and juvenile matters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Family law cases often involve some of the most important and sensitive issues for clients. Steven believes
            in preparing thoroughly, explaining the process clearly, and advocating with skill and compassion in court
            when trial becomes necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            In criminal defense cases, Steven understands that a conviction can have lasting consequences for employment,
            family, and community life. He works to protect constitutional rights and to pursue negotiated resolutions
            where appropriate, while remaining prepared for trial.
          </p>
          <p>
            Steven is a member in good standing with the State Bar of California and is admitted to practice before the
            Supreme Court of the State of California and all subordinate courts. He has been admitted to practice before
            the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of his work as a litigator and trial attorney, Steven is known as a careful negotiator who aims to
            obtain favorable settlements that reduce the cost and stress of courtroom battles.
